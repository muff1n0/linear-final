    <p class="mt-5 ml-5 text-2xl">Looking at Two Knicks vs Celtics Games Through Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) </p>
    <p class="mt-5 ml-5 text-xl">What is NMF?</p>
    <p class="mt-5 ml-5 mr-10 text-base">Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a linear algebra technique that factors a nonnegative matrix V into WH, where
        W and H are both nonnegative. 
        This is a useful technique because it reduces the rank of V, expressing the information in V in terms of other dimensions.
        These dimensions could represent the constituent components that are linearly combined to create an element in V, that is if we
        view V as a list of objects. 
        <br><br>
        For example, suppose that we could unrealistically have a 30 pixel by 30 pixel image of someone's face. And suppose we had 50 of these different
        images of faces. We could read the color values of those pixels as numbers and encode that image in a 30 by 30 matrix. Now, we can "flatten"
        that matrix into a 600 by 1 matrix. Then we could store those 50 600 by 1 column vectors in matrix V.

    </p>
    <p class="mt-5 ml-5 mr-10">
        Let's use NMF on V! We actually get to choose the number of dimensions we reduce the data to. For example, we could either 
        decompose that 600 by 5 matrix into a 600 by 15 matrix and a 15 by 5 matrix, or a 600 by 5 matrix and a 15 by 5 matrix. Miraculously, the column vectors of the W matrix act as an intuitive "basis" for the space the column vectors of V 
        span. By intuitive, I mean that the column vectors of W are actually parts of the face (the nose, mouth, eyes, ears, etc.) if you unflatten them. So what is the matrix H? 
        It turns out that each column of H is the linear combination of W's column vectors that forms one of those images previously encoded.
        Since W and H are both nonnegative, you are intuitively intensifying some of these facial features and combining them together to create a face. 
        NMF basically generates a parts-based decomposition of data. This makes it a useful tool in feature extraction which is useful in text mining and object recognition (See <a class="font-bold" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.5226">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.5226</a>).
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5 ml-5 text-xl">How?</p>
    <p class="mt-5 ml-5 mr-10">
        NMF makes the assumption that V = WH is possible. It isn't always possible so computers run algorithms to estimate W and H. Essentially the problem they solve is minimizing the Frobenius norm of A - WH where A is the matrix you are factoring: 
        <img class="w-50% block m-auto mt-5" src="static/frob.png">
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5 ml-5 mr-10">I am not sure I have the mathematical knowledge to calculate a Frobenius norm but that's fine because we are using a computer program to do it for us!
        The reason NMF produces a parts-based representation is because W and H have to be nonnegative. While doing the matrix multiplication, there's essentially no cancellation
        that's possible in other decomposition methods like PCA. This somehow generates sparse column vectors in W as a side effect.

    <p class="mt-5 ml-5 text-xl">Data Collection</p>
    <p class="mt-5 ml-5 mr-10">
        I watched two full Knicks vs Celtics games (2/23, 4/8) and tracked shot attempts and where individual players shot those shots in a Google Sheets. 
        I decided to record the shot location as the last point of contact between their foot and the ground before they shot the ball. I mapped
        out the halfcourt as a 29 by 25 mesh. So that meant that each player was represented by 29*25=725 by 1 vectors. Each entry in that vector represents shot attempts from a location on the court. 
        I decided to track only the players whom I thought consistently contributed to the team, whatever that means. The players I recorded were: Jalen Brunson, Mitchell Robinson,
        Mikal Bridges, Karl Anthony Towns, Josh Hart, OG Anunoby, Jason Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Al Horford, Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, Prayton Pritchard, and Kristaps
        Porzingis. That's a total of 13 players so I ended up with a 725 by 13 matrix.

    <div class="text-center -mt-85">Rank 10 Factoring</div>
    <p class="mt-10 ml-5 mr-10">Above are the "components" that NMF generated, the darker the color the greater the value. I first asked it for a rank 10 factoring and then I asked it for a rank 2 factoring.
        In the rank 10 factoring, there are several components that represent scoring in the paint and they actually seem a bit redundant. 
        However, the three point show is more intuitively represented. From left to right, component 5, 6, 8, and 10 seem to represent different
        three pointers. Five represents some corner and wing threes while six represents the right corner even more. Eight actually represents
        the right corner and the right wing. Ten represents the top of the key. 
        <br><br>
        In the rank 2 factoring, the first component represents most of the paint scoring while the second component represents
        most of the three which come from mainly the top of the key, the right wing, and the right corner. We can see that the midrange shot is not well
        represented. 
        <br><br>
        Some of these features probably come from the fact that the sample size (2 games) is so small. 
        <br><br>
        Additionally, I looked at some of the players' weighted components. 
        <br><br>
        What was really surprising to me was how, in the rank 2 factoring, both Jalen Brunson and Kristaps Porzingis did not have any of the first component and only had the second component.
        However, Josh Hart had the first component but also had the second component. So, perhaps somehow, the second component has to do with shooters making layups.

    <p class="mt-10 ml-5 mr-10 mb-30">With more data, NMF could maybe be used to figure out what shots players prefer and do not prefer taking. Other teams could used
        this information to set up defenses to counteract them. This model also doesn't account for the accuracy of those shots or the time of the shotclock when
        those shots were taken so this model may not illuminate too many details.
